# Labyrinth-generator
3D labyrinth generator made with Unity. The user can introduce the number of rows and columns that form the labyrinth.

I wanted it to be a multiplayer game, where one of the players can fly and put different types of traps (2 of them are already implemented) in the labyrinth, and the rest of players can only run and find perks inside the labyrinth to find the exit and get out of it, while the flying player tries to avoid it.
